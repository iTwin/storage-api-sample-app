# Storage API Sample App

Copyright Â© Bentley Systems, Incorporated. All rights reserved.

An iTwin sample application that demonstrates how to create, query and update files with folders saved in the Storage.

This application contains sample code that should not be used in a production environment. It contains no retry logic and minimal logging/error handling.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Visual Studio 2019 or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/)

## Development Setup (Visual Studio 2019)

1. Clone Repository

2. Open iTwinStorageSampleApp.sln and Build

3. (Optional) Put breakpoint in Program.cs

4. Run to debug

      - Press Enter

   - Project ID retrieval:
      - Use existing project ID or follow [Create & Query Projects](https://developer.bentley.com/tutorials/create-and-query-projects-guide/) tutorial to create a new project or retrieve existing one.
